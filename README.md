# horror_plus

Additions to D00Med's horror mod https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=12961 for minetest.
It adds new crafting recipes and a new flesh/blood biome in the world, that slowly grows over time. (speed and chance can be modified in init.lua, default speed is 5 and default chance is speed squared.
Made because most of the horror mod's blocks were only available in creative.
